PG:204  7.2 Diagnostics <assert.h>

ref:    2 The assert macro shall be implemented as a macro, not as an actual function. If the
macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function, the behavior is
undefined.

note:   We can not implemente it, so the user who use this lib should concern the naming problem, 
to prevent the herself functions have the same name with these macros.

tips:   not use DEBUG
#define NDEBUG
#include <assert.h>
